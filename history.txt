// History:
//              6-Jul-2008 - Brett Handley - Initial version. Developed using Photoshop CS3. My first Javascript.
//  1.0    19-Jul-2008 - Brett Handley - release version - still not tested for Mac though.
//  1.01 24-Jul-2008 - Brett Handley. Bug fix - ruler units.
//  1.02 26-Jul-2008 - Brett Handley. Redo layout of Preset window using Auto layout. Tweek main dialog.
//  1.03 26-Jul-2008 - Brett Handley. Make menu item show as Save Small JPEG ..., Change name of save
//          button depending on mode, move ok button to right on Edit Preset if Macintosh.
//  1.04 29-Jul-2008 - Brett Handley. CS2 does not have File.changePath() method. Remove use of it.
//  1.05 6-Aug-2008 - Brett Handley. Fixed bug - next first wednesday in month was returning undefined on the actual day.
//  1.06                         Brett Handley. Remove dependence on XML class object (introduced in CS3) so
//           that it will work with CS2. Workarounds, fixes for other CS2 issues. Now works on CS2 and CS3.
//          Can't resolve in CS2 (probably CS2 bugs): preset dialog - alignment of buttons, ask radio button won't load correctly.
//  1.07 10-apr-2011 - Brett Handley. Fixed bug - didn't always get output size within maximum. Added explanation for why outputfile may not be deleted.
//  1.08 23-may-2011 - Brett Handley. Fixed bug - Was using activedocument.fullName property for unsaved files (compliesWithRequirements test) which raised error.
//                                    Open after save checkbox was invisible - CS5 must have changed window behaviour again... Put test for zero when overriding size with preferredsize.
//  1.09 23-may-2011 - Brett Handley. exportDocument (saveforweb) changes spaces to hypens on save - so the script was losing track of the newly created file and couldn't get a filesize. Change to hypens myself earlier.
//  1.10 11-jun-2012 - Brett Handley.
//                            Add subfolder option constants of 'thumbs', 'jpg', 'edi', 'smalljpeg' to give user some more flexibility with saving.
//                            Updated default NCP EDI and Gallery settings for latest values.
//                            Add scriptVersion to settings file.

//                            Make folder option of saveBehaviour explict value of 'saveToSaveFolder' rather being empty string value. Empty string defaults to this option - so as to upgrade old installations.
//                            Fixed bug - was not properly filtering not photoshop files, Add indexOf method to Array prototype.
