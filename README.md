**Save Small JPEG** is an Adobe Photoshop script for preset based exporting of small images.

It's a low fuss way to export Photoshop documents as Jpeg images according to specific pixel resolutions, sRGB colour space and maximum file size.

My original motivation (in 2008) was to use a preset based approach to exporting images for Camera Club members. Camera clubs will have competition requirements that images must meet for entry. Getting the requirements right is a fiddly and error prone process if one is not careful. This script automates that process.  SaveForWeb is an alternative, but is still awkward to get right and bugs around file sizing in different versions was an annoyance.

Now that lightroom is here, many will have no need for this script because they can use the preset export approach in Lightroom.

But if you're a Photoshop user who just wants an easy regularly used way to export PSDs or other images to Jpeg this script has value.

## Contribution and issues

I'm not going to put a lot of time into this other than playing around with code restructuring and user interface ideas, but if you have bug fixes to include that would be great.
